## How to Use

### Develop

```sh
npm start
```

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### Build

```sh

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
